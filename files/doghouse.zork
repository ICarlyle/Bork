Rooms:
Cell
Enemies:Bad Man
Contents: SwoleEmber
Welcome to the Doghouse!  In order to escape, you'll have to find a way up and 
out of the dungeon!  The only way to do that, is to go down...
Deep Down...  

You are in a small, windowless room.  There is an empty mattress resting on the floor. A flickering candle is illuminating the cell door, which is sealed shut.
---
Moldy Cell
Contents: RavenousMold
ARRGGGGHHHGHHGHGHGHGRHGRHGRGRHGGHRHHRGHGHGRHGRHGGHGRHGRHGRHGH
Oh! You are in a small, windowless room.  There is an emptry mattress resting on
the floor.
---
Moon Hall
A black walkway streches out on either side of you.  A hastilly-assembled railing is the only thing keeping you from falling down into the pitch dark.  Beneath the metal grating you can make out the mural of a shimmering moon shrouded by 
red clouds.
---
West Moon Hall
You run your hand along the bars until you reach the end of the walkway.  A 
padded room is here. 
---
White Room
Contents: CrumpledPieceOfPaper,Lightbulb
A dimming lightbulb is collecting dust above your head.  The bottom of a 
crumpled piece of manilla paper is lodged into the corner.  You don't like this room.
---
Fountain Room
Enemies:Fountain
Contents: HeadlessCorpse,SeveredHead
Your legs give out as you collapse onto the top of the mural.  A rounded fountain etched of marble is your only companion.  You think you can make out something slumped over the base of the marble...
---
Spiral Stair
Contents: WoodenPlank
Through a narrow archway, a wooden staircase descends from the fountain.  From 
somewhere close, you can hear the purr of a faint whine.
---
Flooded Stair
An inch of warm water is resting at the base of the stair.  Two dozen unwanted boxes are piled into a corner, and a thick wooden door to the north has sealed off your progress.  The whine has stopped.  You can see some tools floating amidst the boxes...
---
East Basement
The hallway is pitch black.  You wish you could walk without your feet sloshing along in the water, but there's too much here to move without sound.  Directly 
ahead is the shape of another wooden door, light leaking from the cracks.
---
Shallow Pond
As you wade through the foul-smelling water, you can hear the long, hungry groan of a creature in the dark.   A wooden door leads away to the south, but it 
seems to be stuck.
---
Bathroom
Contents: DirtyMirror
Bursts of murky water flood erupt out into the basement.  Aha! The source of the flooding!  A row of stalls is lined up along the far wall.
---
Stall
Enemies:Big Bunny,Moaning Turtle
You burst into the stall.  It's occupied.
---
The Hole
You heave the door shut behind you with some relief.  The room is well-lit, with a generator humming to itself in the corner.  Could that have been the whine?  You sit and listen to the generator.  An enourmous pit has been chiseled out in the center of The Hole, leaving only just enough space to navigate along the
sides of the room. 
---
Forest Path
Contents: YourBody
A twisting path snakes its way up and out of the caverns.  You crawl upwards, 
exhausted.  You squint out into the evening sky as rays of sunlight warm your skin.

Congratulations!  You escaped the DOGHOUSE!
...but you are really hungry so you pass out and are eaten by a cougar.
---
Bottomless Pit I
You are falling down.  Very fast.

---
Small Alcove
A small alcove leads off from the pit.  You huff and you puff and you pull 
yourself up to safety.  
---
Cramped Passage
Enemies:Boulder
A twisting passage formed of stone leads forwards into the dark. 
---
Light Room
The passage opens into a sprawling chamber.  A horizontal beam of light emanates from a statue from the west to the east.  You can see a door to the south,
but it's sealed tight.  A circular panel is etched into stone above the door.  
You think you can make out a dull ruby in the center.     
---
The Dark
You take one step into the room and find yourself flailing upside down.  A 
thick rope is wrapped around your ankle, and you can't see anything.
---
The Pit
Contents: Something
Darkness surrounds you on all sides.  Cutting yourself free from the snare may
have seemed like a good idea at the time but it looks like there's no way back.
Your foot brushes agaisnt the rough surface of Something but you'd rather not
know what. 
---
The Gate
A metal gate is blocking your path.  Just beyond the gate you can see a narrow
path leading up to what may be sunlight.  So close....
---
The Well
A simple well is sitting in the dark, apparently providing water to something
nearby.  You reach down inside but don't feel any bucket.
---
Cliffside Boogies and Knacks
Enemies:Boogie
Contents: String,OldComputer
You pull yourself up and over the side of a cliff.  A creature is bent over a 
campfire, humming to himself.
"Welcome to my abode!"
Boogie gestures to some rocks.
"Here we have many a fine things for sale!  Like cheese!  
..Oh.....a new customer?  Here!  Take this complimentary String!  I insist!
Now don't go snooping around back there, ya hear?"
---
Boogie's Bungalow
You shouldn't be here!
---
The Generator
Contents: SuperMassiveBlackHole
The tip of your shoe is pointing out over the dark.  A body is pressed up 
agaisnt the edge of the wall, its legs hanging over the edge.
---
Upper Study
A hundred candles are alligned evenly amoung the room.  You can tell that this was once an idyllic place of study... but now the shelves are empty, the long tables caked in dust, and the candles lit.  From somewhere below, a howl echoes...
