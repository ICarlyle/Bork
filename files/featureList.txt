Locked Doors (15xp): 
The dungeon engine allows for dungeons to be designed with rooms with locked exits, and corresponding 'key' items to unlock those exits.
The Unlock Event is triggered when a user types in a specific Item command.
To test Locked Doors, try to go (n) from the starting cell and Oh no!  You 
can't.  Instead, you have to Attack Bad Man and Wave the candle he drops on
death in order to unlock the next room and press on.

Npcs (20xp):
In our zork dungeon Npcs only function as enemies to destroy.  They are read
in the zork file in the same way that items are read in.  Each Npc is placed
inside of fixed rooms and cannot leave.  In addition to a description that 
prints on first encounter, every Npc has their own randomly-selected dialogue 
that they will gargle at you every combat turn.  They drop their inventory 
of items on death and award the player points on kill.  Additionally, Npcs have stats for health, strength, and defense.

Combat (25xp):
Upon entering a room of the dungeon, a message will be displayed notifying the
player that he is not alone.  The player initiates combat using the 
AttackCommand such as "Attack Bad Man" where Bad Man is the enemy.
In combat, the player attacks a single enemy per turn.  If the enemy dies,
the enemy cannot attack.  After the player moves, every enemy gets to attack
the poor player.  The combat system is designed around aquiring more strength
and defense that the player can find from various items in the dungeon.

To test combat we reccomend that you first "take DeathJuice" because it grants
you 10 str/def that you need in order to survive the more vicious enemies.
You cannot kill the fountain or the space ship.

You can defeat the Bad Man, who drops an item that is required to progress.
