WalkThrough of PortalDungeon
To win the game, You must find the missing Vice commander of a research team.

The Key to staying alive in a fight is having good stats. Stats can only be aquired by holding items. Note: you will lose the stats when you drop an item.


Tips:
You can skip every enemy by walking past them, but they will not award points or drop items.
There is a certain yellow blob that can give you more health if you are hurt, examine it to find out more details.
